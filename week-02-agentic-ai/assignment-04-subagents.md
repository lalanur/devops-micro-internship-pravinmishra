# Assignment 4 — Building Your AI Team

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will build and configure a set of specialized AI subagents inside your project. You will learn how different models and tool permissions define agent behavior, and you will trigger two real agent delegations to analyze security and cost aspects of your Terraform infrastructure.

# Task 1 — Create the Agents Folder and Add Files

## Goal

Create the `.claude/agents/` directory and add all required agent files.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — VS Code sidebar showing `.claude/agents/` with all 3 files

# Task 2 — Compare the Agent Configurations

## Goal

Analyze the configuration differences between the three agents and demonstrate understanding of model and tool selection.

### Written Answers

#### 1. Why does the cost optimizer use Haiku instead of Sonnet?

Add your answer here...

The cost optimizer carries out focused analysis rather than complex coding reasoning, so Haiku is a good fit because it's faster, cleaner, cost-effective and more direct output. The end result helps reduce AI costs while still delivering accurate optimization suggestions.

#### 2. Why does the security auditor NOT have Write in its tools list?

Add your answer here...

After reviewing the security auditor, it is meant to ensure compliance, inspect and report potential issues, and not make changes. Restricting it to read, Grep, and Glob tools follows the principle of least privilege and prevents accidental or unauthorized modifications.

#### 3. Why does the tf-writer use `inherit` instead of a specific model?

Using inherit model configures a subagent to dynamically use the exact same model as the main parent session. This allows the tf-writer to automatically use whichever model is configured as the default for the session or project. This provides flexibility, making it easier to switch models later without updating the agent's configuration.

# Task 3 — Run the Security Auditor

## Goal

Trigger the security auditor agent and analyze the generated security report for your Terraform infrastructure.

# Task 4 — Run the Cost Optimizer

## Goal

Trigger the cost optimizer agent and review the generated cost optimization report.

### Evidence
